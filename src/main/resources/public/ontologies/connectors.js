In other areas the address number is unique inside an address area name (e.g. the name of the village) or postal designator (e.g. the post code). In some areas even a combination of rules are applied: e.g. addresses with two locators, each of them referencing to a separate address component. NOTE 2 Locators that has the level of unit (like e.g. floor identifier and door or unit identifiers) are most often assigned so that they are unambiguous within the more narrow scope of the property or building; for these locators the association should therefore not be populated. EXAMPLE 1 In a typical European address dataset, parts of the addresses have locators which are unambiguous within the scope of the road name (thoroughfare name) while others are unambiguous within the name ogf the village or district (address area name). EXAMPLE 2 In Lithuania and Estonia a concept of \"corner addresses\" exists. Corner addresses have two address numbers (designators) each of them referring to a thoroughfare name (primary and secondary street name). E.g. in Vilnius the address designated \"A. Stulginskio gatve 4 / A. Smetonos gatve 7\" is situated on the corner of the two streets. EXAMPLE 3 In the Czech Republic in some cities an address has two locator designators: A building number which referres to the address area (district, cz: \"cast obce\") and a address number that referres to the thoroughfare name.

NOTE 2 In some countries several levels of parent-, sub- and sub-sub-addresses exist. In other countries the concept of parent addresses does not exist; all addresses are thus of the same level. EXAMPLE 1 In a Spanish city the address \"Calle Gran V�\" is a parent address where the locator \"8\" represents the building. In the building, the sub address \"Calle Gran Via 8, door 3\" represents a sub-address, while the more detailed sub-sub address \"Calle Gran Via 8, door 3, staircase A, floor 5, dwelling 1\" represents the address of a specific dwelling.

Achtergrond hiervan is dat de locatie van het  object bepalend is voor de vraag in welke woonplaats een adres is gelegen."}},"{2C75C54D-D3E2-4a0f-A1B0-09A0CDCC25F5}":{"sourceEnd":{"lowerBound":0,"upperBound":1},"destEnd":{"lowerBound":0,"upperBound":1}},"{9A69CF92-1771-4b7c-8CF5-6EDC650FA186}":{"sourceEnd":{"lowerBound":1,"upperBound":1},"destEnd":{"lowerBound":0,"upperBound":-1}},"{0F20241B-D6B9-4896-A050-F1D64F9E388A}":{"sourceEnd":{"lowerBound":1,"upperBound":1},"destEnd":{"lowerBound":1,"upperBound":1}},"{D1D80E4F-E5C7-4596-A784-92F9BC74FFED}":{"destEnd":{"lowerBound":0,"upperBound":1,"comment":"Gegevens over het huidige partnerschap (huwelijk / geregistreerd partnerschap, GBA cat. 05)."}},"{831BE072-256B-48c9-A841-7096FD4574B8}":{"sourceEnd":{"lowerBound":0,"upperBound":-1},"destEnd":{"lowerBound":0,"upperBound":-1}},"{F959973F-873E-47f9-A6B0-2F9B449FA9F6}":{"destEnd":{"lowerBound":0,"upperBound":-1}},"{703AE9F5-5A5C-4b60-99C3-BA1D4F04D2E3}":{"destEnd":{"lowerBound":0,"upperBound":1}},"{73B64A11-F7EF-4c61-9EDB-521C46548480}":{"sourceEnd":{"lowerBound":1,"upperBound":1},"destEnd":{"lowerBound":0,"upperBound":-1}},"{93810BAE-511C-4ba6-9472-B4A9D5A541E9}":{"sourceEnd":{"lowerBound":1,"upperBound":1},"destEnd":{"lowerBound":1,"upperBound":-1}},"{F4966158-460E-4209-A211-107B89DA31E0}":{"destEnd":{"lowerBound":0,"upperBound":-1,"comment":"Een document dat is toegevoegd aan een stuk  "}},"{44FC53F9-B224-414a-BE2F-04E69D4D4443}":{"destEnd":{"lowerBound":1,"upperBound":-1}},"{DF0FA481-98DE-4c76-B362-A2D5675326CC}":{"destEnd":{"lowerBound":0,"upperBound":1,"comment":"De partner van de natuurlijk persoon."}},"{558E3FFE-D48F-4711-AA71-2A0FDD1FE43D}":{"sourceEnd":{"lowerBound":0,"upperBound":-1},"destEnd":{"lowerBound":0,"upperBound":1,"comment":"Stukdeel waarin de domiciliekeuze van een persoon vermeld wordt."}},"{509D10D4-2F56-4581-9F92-E017D8A34B64}":{"sourceEnd":{"lowerBound":0,"upperBound":-1},"destEnd":{"lowerBound":0,"upperBound":1}},"{FC6F1EDB-153A-4c92-B8F0-38F802F303CC}":{"destEnd":{"lowerBound":0,"upperBound":1}},"{EE66798A-8177-4c6e-945E-681EBAD60143}":{"destEnd":{"lowerBound":0,"upperBound":-1}},"{A285F7C8-2EFD-4e89-BDEA-D5478A915C2B}":{"destEnd":{"lowerBound":0,"upperBound":1}},"{4D7CB6AE-102E-4214-8AD9-B96BBF3FC1AC}":{"destEnd":{"lowerBound":0,"upperBound":1}},"{43BFE5B0-B15D-43c3-8C9F-1BB7DC70919F}":{"sourceEnd":{"lowerBound":0,"upperBound":-1},"destEnd":{"lowerBound":0,"upperBound":-1,"comment":"Het gerelateerde stukdeel betreft een verwijzing naar een stuk, waarbij de persoon betrokken was als vervreemder of verkrijger, of een stuk dat is aangetekend bij de persoon.
